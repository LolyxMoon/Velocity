## 🚀 Deployment Roadmap

### Phase 1: Deploy to Mainnet (You)

```bash
# 1. Setup environment
# Add to .env: PRIVATE_KEY, BSC_MAINNET_RPC, BSCSCAN_API_KEY

# 2. Deploy factory
npx hardhat run scripts/deployMainnet.js --network bsc

# 3. Create production market
npx hardhat run scripts/createProductionMarket.js --network bsc
```

**Duration**: ~10 minutes  
**Cost**: ~0.15 BNB in gas fees

---

### Phase 2: Web Integration (Your Developer)

**Give your web dev these files:**
1. ✅ `WEB_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` (main guide)
2. ✅ `QUICK_START_WEB_DEV.md` (quick reference)
3. ✅ Contract addresses (after you deploy)
4. ✅ ABI file: `artifacts/contracts/BinaryMarketV2_Fixed.sol/BinaryMarketV2_Fixed.json`

**What they need to do:**
```bash
# Install ethers.js
npm install ethers@6

# Copy provided React components
# Update contract addresses in config
# Wire up YES/NO buttons
# Implement real-time polling
# Test and deploy
```

**Duration**: ~2-3 hours  
**Complexity**: Easy (all code provided)

## 🎯 Production Market Configuration

Your market will have these settings:

| Parameter | Value | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| **Token** | `0x82Ec31D69b3c289E541b50E30681FD1ACAd24444` | Updated as requested |
| **Target** | $444,000,000 | From your website |
| **Deadline** | October 30, 2025 | From your website |
| **Max Bet** | 10 BNB per wallet per side | Prevents whale manipulation |
| **Platform Fee** | 2% | Industry standard |
| **Auto-Resolution** | Yes (via Tellor Oracle) | Trustless resolution |

---

## 📊 Real-Time Features

Your website will have:

✅ **Live odds updating every 3 seconds**  
✅ **Instant updates when anyone bets** (via events)  
✅ **Real-time pool amounts**  
✅ **Live payout calculations**  
✅ **Countdown timer**  
✅ **Wallet connection with auto network switching**  
✅ **Transaction status indicators**  
✅ **Error handling and user feedback**  

All synchronized between smart contract and website in real-time!

## 💰 Economics

### For Users:
- Bet on YES or NO with BNB
- Odds determined by pool sizes (parimutuel)
- Winners split the losing pool
- 2% platform fee on winnings

### For You:
- 2% fee on all winning payouts
- Collected automatically when users claim
- Trustless oracle resolution (no manual work needed)

### Example:
```
Total Bets: 100 BNB
YES Pool: 67 BNB (67%)
NO Pool: 33 BNB (33%)

If YES wins:
- YES bettors split 33 BNB proportionally
- 2% fee on winnings = ~0.66 BNB platform revenue

If NO wins:
- NO bettors split 67 BNB proportionally  
- 2% fee on winnings = ~1.34 BNB platform revenue
```

---

## 🔒 Security Features

✅ **ReentrancyGuard** on all money transfers  
✅ **Deadline enforcement** (can't bet after deadline)  
✅ **Cancellation protection** (can't cancel after deadline)  
✅ **Max bet limits** (prevents manipulation)  
✅ **Oracle dispute period** (1 hour buffer)  
✅ **Immutable parameters** (can't change rules mid-game)  
✅ **Automatic resolution** (no centralized control)  

Security audit completed ✓

## 🎮 How It Works

### User Flow:
```
1. User connects wallet (MetaMask)
2. Site auto-switches to BSC Mainnet
3. User sees live odds (67% YES / 33% NO)
4. User enters bet amount (e.g., 1 BNB)
5. Clicks YES or NO button
6. Confirms transaction in MetaMask
7. Bet is placed → Odds update in real-time
8. After Oct 30, market auto-resolves via oracle
9. Winners click "Claim" to get payout
```

### Technical Flow:
```
Website (React)
  ↓ (ethers.js)
Smart Contract (BSC)
  ↓ (Tellor Oracle)
Resolution (Automatic)
  ↓
Payout (User claims)
```
