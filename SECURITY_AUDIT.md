**Audit Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Auditor:** Internal Review  
**Severity Levels:** 🔴 Critical | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Low | ✅ Info

---

## 🔒 Security Features (Already Implemented)

### ✅ 1. Reentrancy Protection
**Status:** PROTECTED  
**Implementation:** OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`

```solidity
function bet() external payable nonReentrant { ... }
function claim() external nonReentrant { ... }
function resolveFromTellor() external nonReentrant { ... }
```

**Protection:**
- `nonReentrant` modifier on all state-changing functions
- Prevents recursive calls
- Follows checks-effects-interactions pattern

### ✅ 2. Integer Overflow/Underflow Protection
**Status:** PROTECTED  
**Implementation:** Solidity 0.8.24+ built-in checks

- Automatic overflow/underflow detection
- No need for SafeMath library
- Reverts on overflow/underflow

### ✅ 3. Access Control
**Status:** PROTECTED  
**Implementation:** Custom modifiers

```solidity
modifier onlyResolver() { require(msg.sender == resolver, "not resolver"); _; }
```

**Protected Functions:**
- `resolve()` - Only resolver
- `cancel()` - Only resolver
- `resolveFromTellor()` - Anyone (permissionless by design)

### ✅ 4. Immutable Critical Parameters
**Status:** PROTECTED  

```solidity
address public immutable factory;
address public immutable resolver;
uint256 public immutable deadline;
uint256 public immutable maxPerWallet;
bytes32 public immutable queryId;
```

**Protection:**
- Cannot be changed after deployment
- Prevents parameter manipulation attacks

### ✅ 5. State Machine Protection
**Status:** PROTECTED  

```solidity
enum State { Open, Resolved, Cancelled }
```

**Checks:**
- Markets can only be resolved once
- No betting after deadline
- No claiming before resolution
- Proper state transitions

---

## 🔍 Potential Vulnerabilities & Mitigations

### 1. Division by Zero in Payout Calculation

**Location:** Line 207
```solidity
uint256 gross = userWin + (losePool * userWin) / winPool;
```

**Risk:** 🟡 Medium - If everyone bets on same side

**Current Protection:**
- Requires `userWin > 0` (Line 202)
- This implicitly means winPool > 0

**Status:** ✅ MITIGATED - Division by zero cannot occur

---

### 2. Oracle Data Manipulation

**Location:** `resolveFromTellor()` function

**Risk:** 🟡 Medium - Malicious oracle data

**Current Protections:**
```solidity
// Data freshness check
require(deadline - timestampRetrieved <= MAX_DATA_AGE, "oracle data too old");

// Buffer period ensures data availability
require(block.timestamp >= deadline + MIN_BUFFER_TIME);
```

**Additional Protection from Tellor:**
- Dispute mechanism in Tellor
- `_isInDispute()` check (inherited from UsingTellor)
- Multiple reporters required

**Status:** ✅ PROTECTED

---

### 3. Front-Running

**Location:** `bet()` function

**Risk:** 🟢 Low - Users can front-run each other

**Reality:**
- This is expected behavior in parimutuel betting
- Later bets get worse odds naturally
- No specific protection needed (it's game theory)

**Status:** ✅ BY DESIGN

---

### 4. Double Claiming

**Location:** `claim()` function

**Test:** Can user claim twice?

**Protection:**
```solidity
// Line 211
if (winnerYes) yesStake[msg.sender] = 0; 
else noStake[msg.sender] = 0;

// Line 202 - second claim would fail here
require(userWin > 0, "no win");
```

**Status:** ✅ PROTECTED - Stakes zeroed after claim

---

### 5. Bet Cap Bypass

**Location:** `bet()` function

**Test:** Can user bypass maxPerWallet?

**Protection:**
```solidity
uint256 totalForUser = yes ? yesStake[msg.sender] + msg.value : noStake[msg.sender] + msg.value;
require(totalForUser <= maxPerWallet, "exceeds cap");
```

**Possible Attack:** Use multiple wallets

**Reality:** This is expected and acceptable
- Sybil resistance is not the goal
- Cap is per-wallet by design
- Would need many wallets (costly in gas)

**Status:** ✅ BY DESIGN

---

### 6. Timestamp Manipulation

**Location:** Deadline checks

**Risk:** 🟢 Low - Miners can manipulate timestamps slightly

**Impact:**
- Miners can shift timestamp ±15 seconds
- Very minimal impact on markets with long deadlines
- Cannot significantly affect oracle data timestamp

**Status:** ✅ ACCEPTABLE RISK

---

### 7. Receiving Ether Directly

**Location:** `receive()` function

**Protection:**
```solidity
receive() external payable { revert("use bet"); }
```

**Status:** ✅ PROTECTED - Must use `bet()` function

---

### 8. Claim Calculation Precision Loss

**Location:** Payout calculation

**Risk:** 🟢 Low - Integer division rounding

```solidity
uint256 gross = userWin + (losePool * userWin) / winPool;
```

**Impact:**
- Some wei may be lost to rounding
- Affects all users proportionally
- Dust amount (< 1 gwei per transaction)

**Status:** ✅ ACCEPTABLE - Standard for EVM

---

### 9. Gas Griefing

**Location:** `_send()` function

**Risk:** 🟢 Low - Recipient contract could waste gas

```solidity
function _send(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    (bool ok, ) = to.call{value: amount}("");
    require(ok, "send failed");
}
```

**Potential Attack:**
- Malicious recipient contract with expensive fallback
- Could make claiming expensive for contract

**Current Protection:**
- Uses `.call{value}()` (forwards all gas)
- Reverts if send fails

**Status:** ✅ ACCEPTABLE - Standard pattern

---

### 10. Cancellation After Deadline

**Location:** `cancel()` function

**Risk:** 🟡 Medium - Resolver could cancel after outcome known

**Current Code:**
```solidity
function cancel() external onlyResolver {
    require(state == State.Open, "already resolved");
    state = State.Cancelled;
}
```

**Issue:** ⚠️ No deadline check!

**Recommendation:** 🔴 Add deadline restriction
```solidity
function cancel() external onlyResolver {
    require(block.timestamp < deadline, "past deadline");
    require(state == State.Open, "already resolved");
    state = State.Cancelled;
}
```

**Status:** 🟡 NEEDS FIX

---

### 11. Empty Pool Payout

**Location:** `claim()` function when cancelled

**Risk:** 🟢 Low - Division issues if pool is empty

**Protection:**
```solidity
// Cancellation path doesn't divide
uint256 refund = yesStake[msg.sender] + noStake[msg.sender];
```

**Status:** ✅ PROTECTED

---

### 12. Oracle QueryId Mismatch

**Location:** Constructor

**Risk:** 🟡 Medium - Wrong queryId set at creation

**Current Protection:**
```solidity
require(_queryId != bytes32(0), "bad queryId");
```

**Issue:** Only checks for zero, not correctness

**Recommendation:** Factory should validate queryId matches token address

**Status:** 🟡 IMPROVEMENT NEEDED

---

## 🧪 Recommended Security Tests

### Test 1: Reentrancy Attack
```javascript
// Malicious contract tries to re-enter claim()
// Expected: Reverts due to ReentrancyGuard
```

### Test 2: Double Claim
```javascript
// User claims twice
// Expected: Second claim reverts with "no win"
```

### Test 3: Bet After Deadline
```javascript
// User tries to bet after deadline
// Expected: Reverts with "after deadline"
```

### Test 4: Unauthorized Resolution
```javascript
// Non-resolver tries to call resolve()
// Expected: Reverts with "not resolver"
```

### Test 5: Division by Zero
```javascript
// Create market where everyone bets YES, resolve to YES
// Expected: Payout calculation works (returns original stake)
```

### Test 6: Claim Before Resolution
```javascript
// User tries to claim while market is Open
// Expected: Reverts with "not finished"
```

### Test 7: Overflow in Bet
```javascript
// User tries to bet type(uint256).max
// Expected: Reverts with overflow error
```

## 🔧 Recommended Fixes

### Priority 1: Prevent Late Cancellation

```solidity
function cancel() external onlyResolver {
    require(block.timestamp < deadline, "cannot cancel after deadline");
    require(state == State.Open, "already resolved");
    state = State.Cancelled;
    emit Cancelled();
}
```

### Priority 2: Factory QueryId Validation

```solidity
// In MarketFactoryV2
function createMarket(...) {
    // Validate queryId matches expected format
    bytes32 expectedQueryId = generateQueryId(tokenAddress);
    require(_queryId == expectedQueryId, "invalid queryId");
    ...
}
```

---

## ✅ Conclusion

The BinaryMarketV2 contract is **generally secure** with good use of industry-standard protection mechanisms. The main concern is the ability to cancel after the deadline, which should be fixed before production deployment.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. ✅ Implement deadline check in `cancel()`
2. ✅ Add comprehensive test suite
3. ✅ Consider professional audit for mainnet
4. ✅ Test with maximum gas price scenarios

**Overall:** Ready for testnet deployment with noted fixes needed before mainnet.
